Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!,,
"""Stay on message"" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!",,
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!,,
"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!",,
"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!",,
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!,,

RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: DEAD HEAT: CLINTON VS TRUMP https://t.co/wqfQMEMQOj,,
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!,,
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - cant make a deal work.,,
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.,,
Lyin Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!,,
Lyin Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!,,
"Wow, just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!",,
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!,,
